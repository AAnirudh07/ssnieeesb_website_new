      IEEE's core
      purpose is to promote technological innovation and excellence for the
      benefit of humanity. IEEE is essential to the global technical
      community and to technical professionals everywhere. It is universally
      recognized for its contributions to technology and in improving the ease of living. IEEE is the world's largest
      technical professional society. It is designed to serve professionals
      involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic and computing fields
      and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern
      civilization. IEEE's roots go back to 1884. There was one major
      established electrical industry, the telegraph, which had come to connect
      the world with a communications system faster than the speed of
      transportation. A second major area had only barely gotten
      underwayâ€”electric power and light, originating in Thomas Edison's
      inventions. There are more than 400,000 IEEE members in over 160 countries
      around the world. IEEE members are engineers, scientists and associated
      professionals whose technical interests are innate in science and
      technology related fields. IEEE, consisting of 2,173 student branches at
      colleges and universities in 80 countries, has over 107,000 student
      members. Women in Engineering (WIE) is one of the patent entities of
      IEEE's Affinity Group. IEEE publishes more than 148 transactions, journals
      and magazines. The IEEE Xplore Digital Library has over three million
      documents, available for download and reference.

      The IEEE student Branch of SSN College of Engineering was formed on May 2,
      1998. From then, there was no looking back! The objective of starting the IEEE Student Branch was to create awareness about
      day-to-day technological developments, to utilize the
      resources available in IEEE, and to make the student members
      involve themselves in publishing research papers and projects. The SSN IEEE Student Branch started with 10 student
      members in 1998. Every year since then, the number of student members
      increased exponentially and as of 2022 the branch has 200+ members! The IEEE Student Branch has
      organized many events to provide outstanding value to its members.
